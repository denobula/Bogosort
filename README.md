# Bogosort
Useless sorting algorithm, just randomizing the string as long as it is not sorted.

It was fun to implement, trying to reduce the library functionalities as much as possible.
Very useful was the knowledge achieved by using malloc, free and of course the pointers(again).
Therefore I also tried to implement a pseudo ft_rand(), may be working on linux, but not on windows.
